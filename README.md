Tremor Tracking

The app has not been distributed to the OS stores. To try it on Android, it can be downloaded directly from the GitHub repository of the app. Another installation method for Android, and the only method for iOS is by cloning the repository, connecting the phone to the computer or  starting an emulator, and then running the following command from the app directory terminal:
```
flutter run
```

Note that as the database is stored locally on the phone, when installed, the visualizations will be empty until new measurements are recorded.
